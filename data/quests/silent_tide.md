# Started
```flow
Your logbook is full of patterns. The tide of sleepers drifts in a steady pulse, and you set out to learn why.
```

# Goals

## Ordinary World
```flow
The archives are quiet, the records heavy, and the city survives by listening more than shouting.
```

## Call to Adventure
```flow
A new rhythm rises from the harbor. Track it before it swells.
```

## Refusal of the Call
```flow
Leaving the stacks feels like leaving the past. The risk is real, and so is the fear.
```

## Meeting the Mentor
```flow
Ash shares drift wisdom: move slow, breathe low, and let the sleepers pass.
```

## Crossing the Threshold
```flow
You step onto the silent docks, where the tide hums against empty hulls.
```

## Tests and Allies
```flow
Gather quiet testimonies from the tavern and the clinic. The pattern is shared, not owned.
```

## Approach
```flow
You chart the pulse lines back toward the Broadcast Tower and the old signal corridors.
```

## Ordeal
```flow
The stairwell is still. You reach the inner console without waking the drift.
```

## Reward
```flow
The harmonic key is clear at last: a tone that guides, not commands.
```

## The Road Back
```flow
Bring the pattern to the settlement and translate it for those who only hear silence.
```

## Resurrection
```flow
The first broadcast is a trial of trust. The tide turns without panic.
```

## Return with the Elixir
```flow
You teach the city to listen, and the sleepers to follow a gentler path.
```

# Passed
```flow
The Silent Tide becomes a living practice, and the city learns to survive without violence.
```
