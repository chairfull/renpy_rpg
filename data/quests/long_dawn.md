# Started
```flow
The settlement is quiet, the sleepers drift beyond the lights.
A faint signal repeats from the old broadcast tower.
Coordinator Mara asks you to investigate.
```

# Goals

## Call to Adventure

Find the source of the signal at the Broadcast Tower.
```

## Refusal and Need

Supplies are thin. You must secure food and a camp kit before leaving.
```

## Meeting the Mentor
```flow
Speak with Clinician Elena about the sleepers and the rumor of a cure.
```

## Crossing the Threshold
```flow
Leave the safe district and reach the Outskirts.
```

## Tests, Allies, and Strangers
```flow
Gain help from a scout or a signalist. Listen for what the sleepers respond to.
```

## The Approach
```flow
Restore power to the tower lobby and access the sealed control room.
```

## The Ordeal
```flow
Navigate the silent crowd without harm. Use sound and light to pass.
```

## The Reward
```flow
Recover the broadcast protocol and the recipe for the calming serum.
```

## The Road Back
```flow
Return to the settlement with the protocol.
```

## The Return

Share the protocol to guide the sleepers away from the safe zone.
```

# Passed

The settlement hears the signal.
The sleepers turn and drift toward the horizon.
You return with the elixir: hope.
```
