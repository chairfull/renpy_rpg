# Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines

Main Story Summary

## Prologue – The Illegal Embrace

In Los Angeles, a fledgling vampire is created without permission. The sire is executed by Prince Sebastian LaCroix of the Camarilla for violating vampire law. Instead of killing the fledgling as well, LaCroix spares them and binds them to his service.

The fledgling is sent to Santa Monica to prove their worth and clean up a Sabbat incursion.

---

## Santa Monica – Proving Grounds

You eliminate Sabbat forces led by Bishop Vick and stabilize the district. During this time, an ancient sarcophagus—recovered from an archaeological dig in Turkey—arrives in Los Angeles. Rumors spread that it contains an Antediluvian, one of the mythical founders of the vampire clans.

LaCroix becomes obsessed with obtaining it.

---

## Downtown – Political Web

The sarcophagus is stored in the Museum of Natural History. You retrieve it for LaCroix after a heist complicated by Sabbat interference.

You meet key power players:

* Nines Rodriguez (Anarch leader)
* Maximillian Strauss (Tremere regent)
* Isaac Abrams (Hollywood Anarch baron)
* Gary Golden (Nosferatu primogen)
* Ming Xiao (Kuei-Jin leader in Chinatown)

Tensions between Camarilla and Anarchs escalate. Shortly after the sarcophagus arrives at Venture Tower, Nines is framed for an attack on LaCroix.

---

## The Blood Hunt

LaCroix declares a Blood Hunt on Nines. The city edges toward civil war. Evidence later surfaces that the attack was staged. The true manipulator is gradually revealed to be the Sabbat, led by Andrei the Tzimisce, and possibly others working behind the scenes.

You continue acting as LaCroix’s enforcer, eliminating threats and investigating the sarcophagus’ origins.

---

## Hollywood – The Trail Widens

You uncover the fate of Alistair Grout, the Malkavian primogen, whose death was used to justify the Blood Hunt. His murder was engineered to inflame tensions.

You also discover deeper Sabbat operations and learn that the sarcophagus may not contain what LaCroix believes.

---

## Chinatown – The Kuei-Jin Move

Ming Xiao, leader of the Kuei-Jin, reveals her own ambitions. She seeks the sarcophagus as well. She manipulates events to destabilize the Camarilla and weaken all factions.

The fledgling becomes a pivot point. Multiple factions attempt to recruit or use them:

* LaCroix demands loyalty.
* Strauss offers a more cautious Camarilla alternative.
* The Anarchs push for independence.
* Ming Xiao proposes alliance.

---

## The Truth About the Sarcophagus

Clues indicate the sarcophagus may be a trap. Beckett, the independent Gangrel scholar, repeatedly warns that ancient vampire legends are often misunderstood.

Despite warnings, LaCroix insists on opening it.

---

## Endgame – Venture Tower

Depending on alliances, you confront Ming Xiao in Chinatown and eliminate her.

You return to Venture Tower where LaCroix finally opens the sarcophagus.

Inside is not an Antediluvian—but explosives. The device detonates, killing LaCroix. The entire struggle was orchestrated as a manipulation, using the Prince’s ambition against him.

The true mastermind implied behind the long game: Jack.

---

## Epilogue

The power vacuum reshapes Los Angeles. Outcomes vary:

* Anarch victory and Camarilla collapse.
* Strauss assumes leadership.
* Independent survival.
* Kuei-Jin defeat.
* Or self-serving lone survival.

The fledgling rises from disposable pawn to one of the most powerful vampires in the city—by surviving every faction’s attempt to use them.

Ancient monsters were never the real threat.

Ambition was.
