# Started
```flow
You check your route map and count the turns to the Broadcast Tower.
A mayor at the line says the signal shifted again and wants anything you learn.
Mara sends a runner to learn why the Broadcast Tower changed its pulse and how to guide the sleepers without harm.
```

# Goals

## Ordinary World
```flow
Routines hold the line - logbooks, rations, and quiet rules.
```

## Call to Adventure
```flow
The Spire shifts again. Find the source and bring back a peaceful answer.
```

## Refusal of the Call
```flow
The guardhouse warns that noise means danger. Doubt settles in before the gates.
```

## Meeting the Mentor
```flow
Lena teaches how to step between beats and mark safe lanes without drawing the drift.
```

## Crossing the Threshold
```flow
You pass the last sandbags and enter the overgrowth, counting your breaths.
```

## Tests and Allies
```flow
Greta needs wood and stone to tune a signal baton that guides instead of harms.
```

## Approach
```flow
The safe route narrows. The Broadcast Tower rises ahead, low and listening.
```

## Ordeal
```flow
Inside the lobby, sleepers drift like fog. You move quietly, hands open, heart steady.
```

## Reward
```flow
A data drive holds the broadcast pattern. It is warm with the city's memory.
```

## The Road Back
```flow
The return run favors patience over speed. Follow the dead zones home.
```

## Resurrection
```flow
Mara and Greta test a soft counter-tone. The sleepers turn without panic.
```

## Return with the Elixir
```flow
Routes are updated, the new tone is logged, and the city breathes easier.
```

# Passed
```flow
The Spire remains a warning, but the settlement now knows how to guide the drift without violence.
```
