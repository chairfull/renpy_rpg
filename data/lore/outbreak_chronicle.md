The first reports were not of violence, but of silence.

People would stop mid-sentence and simply drift, eyes open, breathing steady.
They followed rhythm and light, not hunger. The hospitals filled, then the streets.

A handful of districts learned to guide them with music and lanterns.
The notes end with a single line:
"If we can tune the signal, we can lead them home."
